# myOwnFtw
This is a implementation of my own ftw, called myftw8, which execute the same behavior as the ftw function.
I modified the sample source code of ftw, which is from the APUE chapter 4.22, with the function "chdir" & "readdire" and recursive way.

##How to compile & run this program
This program is written in Linux environment, GUN make, and GCC(Gnu compiler collection.)
Just type the commands (in BASH shell),
```
make ftw8
```

or

```
make clean ftw8
```
It will automatically compile all the necessary files/codes, then generate the execution file.
Then type this,
```
./EXENAME __DIRECTORY__
```

In the end, it will work successfully.
